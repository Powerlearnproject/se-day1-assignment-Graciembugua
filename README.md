# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is an application of a systemic desciplined and quantifiable approach to the development,operation qand maintenance of a software that is application engineering to software.
importance
it leads to innovation eg emerging technologies like AI and IoT which are very important in todays world.
It enables scalability in terms of keeping up with customers needs and business demands.
It leads to reduced costs and risks due to good planning and development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The term software engineering was first used in 1968 by NATO. This major event marked its genesis.
Object oriented programming occured in the 1980s . it was based on the idea of objects which enabled reusable and scalable code by organizing software into self contained objects.
The start of 2020 saw the rising of major technologies like AI and machine learning which led to smarter applications.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design-this is where one designs how the software will look and work .
Development-writing code to bring project to life.
Testing-finding bugs and fixing them
Deployment- launching project into the world.
Maintenance-post launch care


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is like a linear flow.one step finishes before the next starts .Agile focuses on small rapid sections called sprints. Waterfall will be more suitable where projects are very stable and unlikely to change eg healthcare software. Agile method is used in projects that are flexible and more likely to changeeg mobile app development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- designs, buids, tests and maintains software applications.
Quality assuarance engineer-makes sure a particular software reaches a degree of standard before it is released to the community.
Project manager-responsible for overseeing software projects to ensure they are completed within budget and within allocated time.
Software engineering team- they collaborate in desgining, building ,testing and maintaining software applications 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES ensure code efficiency by  detecting errors and the completion of code eg visual studio code. VCS are important because one can collaborate  with multiple developers so that they can work on the same project.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Security issues
sol:keeping software updated to the latest security softwares  and patching it regularly.
Managing time  and beating deadlines
sol: Using project management tools like jira and asana
Burnouts 
sol:Taking breaks in between  work to relax.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit- isolating different components of software  and testing them to ensure they work approprietly. 
imp: ensureing different components work effectively in early development.
intergration- ensuring different modules work together as expected .
imp:ensures information flows well between different modules.
system- tests entire application to ensure it meets all non-functional and functional needs.
imp: ensures that project works well in real world  sittuations.
Acceptance- ensures that software application meets all user requirements before it is released.
imp:ensures software meets user and business needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the activity of comming up with effective instructions that guide AI models  like gemini to generate high quality and accurate responses.
imp:
Reduces misinterpration and therefore the probability of  wrong answers.
Facilitates collaboration between AI and humans so that it is as an effective method of brain storming and problem solving.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague:write a story
specific: write me a clear story about the titanic disaster that occured in 1912.
